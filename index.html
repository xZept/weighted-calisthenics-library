                <p>A vertical pushing movement great for developing the triceps, lower chest, and the front delts. Although pike pushups are better for targeting the shoulder, dips also gets the job done. Plus, it is easier to add weight.</p>

                <p>A horizontal pushing movement that targets the upper chest, triceps, and front delts. Personally, I prefer doing incline push-ups on rings at a decline to emphasize the upper chest. This compliments the dips.</p>

                <p>A vertical pulling movement that targets the width of whole back, forearms, and biceps. One of the best pulling movements that will literally give you wings. Even the bodyweight only variation is challenging enough for newbie to intermediate athletes!</p>

                <p>A horizontal pulling movement that targets the thickness of the back, biceps, and forearms. This movement grearly compliments weighted pullups. Contrary to the pull-ups, I prefer doin these for high volume.</p>

                <p>A squat movement that targets the quads. Even though I don't recommend overloading them, this movement is the largest contributor to my leg development. The balance demand will ensure that you are mechanically disadvantaged, providing sufficient stimulus for quad development.</p>

                <p>A difficult hamstring exercise. This exercise is very challenging even without weights. Personally, I can only perform the band assisted movement.</p>
